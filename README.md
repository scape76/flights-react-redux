Unfotunately, had some troubles with that API (it keeps sending a couple of the flights), so I decided to look for a new API (gonna rewrite the functionality completely)

To start: 
1. Clone the repo
2. Install LTS <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Nodejs</a>
3. run npm install to install all the necessary dependencies
3. run npm start and open http://localhost:8080
